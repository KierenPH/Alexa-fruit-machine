# Alexa-fruit-machine
A small alexa funtion for a fruit machine, its a simple machine but works quite well, although not the most efficent. Check it out [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kieren-Hamman-Fruit-Machine/dp/B08R5F45NP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=alexa+fruit+machine&qid=1615932132&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1)

# Setup

1. You need to go to https://developer.amazon.com and navigate to the Alexa Skills Kit setup. Create a new skill.
2. There are a few intents that you need to setup, please check the intents file in the repository, It should have a json that you can just copy paste into the amazon developer console to generate the intents.
3. Once you've setup your intents, you can import the code into your skill. Go to the code section of the amazon developer board and create and copy paste the relevent files into the system.
4. In the file databaseinteractor.py it requires a MongoDB access link, you can host your own MongoDB server or create a free one on MongoDB atlas here: https://www.mongodb.com/. 
5. Once you've setup the database it should work, if not let me know. 

# What can you use this for?
The skill is already on the Alexa skills store, but I hope this code might allow you guys to learn a bit of how ASK works and how to make skills using it. If you have any questions, I'm always happy to answer them if I can. Please contact me at Hello@kieren.uk if you have any questions!
